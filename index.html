            <h2>Well-known Quotes</h2>
            <blockquote>If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end; if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>When Christ died, He died for you individually just as much as if you'd been the only man in the world.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Part of every misery is, so to speak, the misery's shadow or reflection: the fact that you don't merely suffer but have to keep on thinking about the fact that you suffer. I not only live each endless day in grief, but live each day thinking about living each day in grief.</blockquote>
            <blockquote>Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ, and you will find Him, and with Him everything else thrown in.</blockquote>
